# Introduction
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
## Problems you want to find answers
- What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?
- The interaction amongst various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing.
- What operating conditions needs to be in place to ensure a successful landing program.

# Executive Summary
In an intensely competitive business landscape, SpaceX has emerged as a pioneer in the aerospace industry through its groundbreaking approach of reusing the initial stage launcher/booster of the Falcon 9 rocket, resulting in substantial cost savings amounting to millions of dollars.

To maintain its competitive edge in cost-efficiency compared to traditional launchers, the success of Falcon 9 missions hinges on specific factors, including:
Orbit 
Payload mass 
Booster version 
launch sites
The research conducted for this report led to the development of a  supervised machine learning classification model. This model, with an accuracy rate nearing 94%, successfully predicts the outcome of booster recovery based on these critical mission features.
